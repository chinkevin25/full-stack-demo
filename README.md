# STEP 0: Project Initialization

First we run `npm init` in terminal to begin a new project. 
* `npm init -y` if you want to answer yes to all the defaults.

This will prompt us to fill out information relating to the project. For more information refer to the [package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) for more information.

This will create the `package.json` file.

In `Step 1` we will install the necessary packages to create a very basic server.
