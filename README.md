A walkthrough of building a full stack application using MongoDB, Express, React, Node.

# How to use this walkthrough
This is just _**one**_ way of making a full stack application. There are many ways to skin a cat.

Use this as a **tool** to understand larger code bases. **Do not** memorize the components of a full stack application. Each of these steps break down the steps necessary in an application. Study and understand **each** step so we can understand what is going on when we look at a code base.
